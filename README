w2go - the web 2.0 go application

An experimental HTML5 project to create a Go application within the browser.

The initial scope is to create a versatile SGF browser, with the possibility to
play additional moves by yourself -- essentially a tool for studying tsumego.
To support this well, there are plans to create a backing web application that
contains various sets of tsumego (from freely available sources). The web
application would support tracking your progress through these sets.

A full-blown SGF editor could be the next step after that, with the ability to
record games as they are played and save them to a persistent database for
later study. Further development ideas include the option for creating your own
tsumego and publishing it for others to view, solve and comment.

The application has been tested to work with Safari 5, Google Chrome 10 and
Firefox 4 beta 8 on Mac OS X so far.

Opera is not supported until they fully implement canvas -- they are currently
missing some optional (but vital) arguments for the putImageData function.
Firefox only added support for these arguments very recently, in Firefox 4.0b8.

The application uses Sinatra as its framework. To get your local copy running,
run w2go.rb and point your browser to http://localhost:4567/ . The application
is being developed with Ruby 1.9 and it requires the gems 'sinatra' and 'haml'.
